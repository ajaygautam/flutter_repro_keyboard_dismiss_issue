# flutter_repro_keyboard_dismiss_issue

Reproduction of issue at https://github.com/MisterJimson/flutter_keyboard_visibility/issues/37

PS: Looks like this issue is not happening with package `keyboard_visibility`. Updated the app to support both `keyboard_visibility` and `flutter_keyboard_visibility`. In `main.dart`, if `switchToKeyboardVisibility`... is set true... the app will use `keyboard_visibility` package. If false, the app will use `flutter_keyboard_visibility`.
